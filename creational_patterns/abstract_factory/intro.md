## Abstract Factory Pattern
This creational design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates the creation of various components that make up a complete system, allowing you to create different configurations or variations of that system.

### Key Benefits
- Flexibility: Easily assemble different system configurations without modifying client code.
- Consistency: Ensure that components within a configuration are compatible and work together seamlessly.
- Interchangeability: Swap system configurations effortlessly by using different factory implementations.

### Imagine this
You're designing a furniture store application that sells chairs and sofas. However, you want to offer different styles of furniture: modern and Victorian.

- Modern Style: Sleek lines, minimalist design, metal and glass materials.
- Victorian Style: Ornate details, curved lines, wood and fabric materials.


### Abstract Factory to the Rescue
Instead of having separate creation logic for each furniture item in each style, you use the Abstract Factory pattern:

1. **Abstract Factory (Interface)**: Define an interface with methods for creating each type of furniture item (e.g., create_chair, create_sofa).

2. **Concrete Factories**: Create separate factories for each style (e.g., ModernFurnitureFactory, VictorianFurnitureFactory). Each factory implements the interface's methods and creates furniture items specific to its style.

3. **Products**: These are the actual furniture items (chairs, sofas) that the factories create. Each product family (Modern, Victorian) has its own set of products.

### Benefits
- Simplified Furniture Creation: Create a complete set of furniture in a specific style with a single call to the appropriate factory.
- Style Consistency: Ensure that all furniture items created by the same factory match the chosen style.
- Easy Style Switching: Switch between furniture styles by simply changing the factory you use.

### Code
```
# Abstract Factory Interface
class FurnitureFactory
  def create_chair
    raise NotImplementedError
  end

  def create_sofa
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end

# Concrete Factories
class ModernFurnitureFactory < FurnitureFactory
  def create_chair
    ModernChair.new
  end

  def create_sofa
    ModernSofa.new
  end
end

class VictorianFurnitureFactory < FurnitureFactory
  def create_chair
    VictorianChair.new
  end

  def create_sofa
    VictorianSofa.new
  end
end

# Products
class ModernChair
  # ...
end

class ModernSofa
  # ...
end

class VictorianChair
  # ...
end

class VictorianSofa
  # ...
end

# Usage
modern_factory = ModernFurnitureFactory.new
victorian_factory = VictorianFurnitureFactory.new

modern_chair = modern_factory.create_chair
modern_sofa = modern_factory.create_sofa

victorian_chair = victorian_factory.create_chair
victorian_sofa = victorian_factory.create_sofa
```
