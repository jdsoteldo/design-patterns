## Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This means that no matter how many times you try to create an object of that class, you'll always get the same instance.

### Key Benefits
- Controlled Access: Restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object, ensuring there's only one instance throughout the application.
- Global Access Point: Provides a global access point to the single instance, making it easily accessible from anywhere in the code.
- Resource Efficiency: Avoids unnecessary object creation and memory consumption by reusing the same instance.

### Imagine this
You're developing a logging system for your logistics application. You want to ensure that all logs are written to the same file, regardless of where the logging calls are made from within the codebase.

Singleton to the Rescue
Instead of creating multiple instances of a Logger class, which could lead to separate log files, you use the Singleton pattern:

1. Private Constructor: Make the constructor of the Logger class private to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class.

2. Static Instance Variable: Create a private static variable within the class to hold the single instance of the logger.

3. Static Access Method: Provide a public static method (often named instance) that returns the single instance of the logger. This method creates the instance if it doesn't exist yet and returns the existing instance if it already exists.

### Benefits
- Single Log File: All log entries are written to the same file, ensuring centralized logging.
- Consistent Access: The logging mechanism is accessed through a single point (Logger.instance), simplifying the code.
- Resource Management: Avoids creating unnecessary logger objects, conserving memory.

### Code
```
class Logger
  private_class_method :new # Make constructor private

  @@instance = nil  # Private static variable to hold the instance

  def self.instance
    @@instance ||= new  # Create the instance if it doesn't exist
  end

  def log(message)
    # Logic to write the message to the log file
    puts "Logging: #{message}" 
  end
end

# Usage
Logger.instance.log("Application started")
Logger.instance.log("User logged in")
```
