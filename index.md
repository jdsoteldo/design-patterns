## [Creational Patterns](/creational_patterns):
### Purpose
These patterns provide mechanisms to create objects in a flexible and reusable way, abstracting the instantiation process. They promote loose coupling between the client code and the objects being created, making the system more adaptable to changes.

### Focus
They aim to hide the specific details of object creation and allow the client to work with an abstract interface or superclass. This enables the system to dynamically choose the concrete class to instantiate, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

### Examples
- [Abstract Factory](/creational_patterns/abstract_factory/intro.md)
- [Builder](/creational_patterns/builder/intro.md) 
- [Factory Method](/creational_patterns/factory_method/intro.md)
- [Singleton](/creational_patterns/singleton/intro.md)


## [Structural Patterns]():
### Purpose
These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, promoting flexibility and reusability. They help establish relationships between different components of a system, making it easier to manage and maintain complex structures.

### Focus
They focus on simplifying the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. They help to achieve a balance between flexibility and efficiency, allowing different parts of the system to collaborate effectively while maintaining a clean and understandable structure.


## [Behavioral Patterns]():
### Purpose 
These patterns deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They facilitate communication and interaction between objects, enabling them to collaborate to achieve complex behaviors.
### Focus 
They aim to identify common communication patterns between objects and encapsulate them within reusable components. This promotes flexibility, as different objects can be plugged into the system without affecting its overall behavior. They also make the code more readable and easier to maintain by separating concerns and promoting loose coupling.
